Mars' two moons were also to be analyzed. Mariner 9 more than met its objectives.",
    "The Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions consisted of identical spacecraft, each with a bus/orbiter module and an attached descent/lander module. The primary scientific objective of the Mars 3 descent module was to perform a soft landing on Mars, return images from the surface, and return data on meteorological conditions, atmospheric composition, and mechanical and chemical properties of the soil. Mars 3 was the first spacecraft to make a successful soft landing on Mars.",
    "This mission was the first to be sent to the outer solar system and the first to investigate the planet Jupiter, after which it followed an escape trajectory from the solar system. More than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions. The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and polarimetry of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the zodiacal light. Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.",
    "The primary objectives of the Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars, perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites, act as a communications relays for the landers, and to perform their own scientific investigations. The orbiter, based on the earlier Mariner 9 spacecraft, was an octagon approximately 2.5 m across. The total launch mass was 2328 kg, of which 1445 kg were propellant and attitude control gas. The power was provided by eight 1.57 x 1.23 m solar panels, two on each wing. The solar panels were made up of a total of 34,800 solar cells and produced 620 W of power at Mars.",
    "Pioneer 11 was the second mission to investigate Jupiter and the outer solar system and the first to explore the planet Saturn and its main rings. Pioneer 11, like Pioneer 10, used Jupiter's gravitational field to alter its trajectory radically. It passed close to Saturn and then it followed an escape trajectory from the solar system.",
    "Voyager 2 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet;  provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.",

The goal of the mission is to understand the formation of the Plutonian system, the Kuiper belt, and the transformation of the early Solar System.",
    "From the beginning, Elon Musk wanted the first stage of SpaceX launch vehicles to be recoverable, and all Falcon 1 launches and the first two Falcon 9 launches had parachutes. However the boosters burned up on reentry, before the parachutes even deployed.This meant a different approach had to be taken. Experimental prototypes were built and flown during 2012 to 2014 to test the idea of propulsive landings and gain experience. SpaceX first announced in March 2013 that it would instrument and equip subsequent Falcon 9 first stages as controlled-descent test vehicles, able to propulsively decelerate towards a soft touchdown over the water surface.",
    "The program aims to facilitate a crewed lunar landing in the 2030s and possibly the building of an outpost near the south pole. This mission will attempt to determine the age and composition of an unexplored region of the Moon, as well as develop technologies required for the later stages of the program. Since the lander is on the far side, the Moon is blocking direct radio contact with the Earth, so a relay satellite is used for communications."

    "The V-2 rocket became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the Kármán line (edge of space) with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944. At launch the A-4 propelled itself for up to 65 seconds on its own power, and a program motor held the inclination at the specified angle until engine shutdown, after which the rocket continued on a ballistic free-fall trajectory.",
    "The fruit flies were launched as part of a research mission. The unnamed rocket travelled 100km into the air before parachuting back to Earth. NASA currently recognises the altitude of 100km as the point where space officially begins. Therefore, the fruit flies are considered the first animals ever to reach the final frontier.",
    "Sputnik 1 was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 as part of the Soviet space program. It sent a radio signal back to Earth for three weeks until the on-board chemical batteries failed, and then was orbiting for two months until atmospheric drag caused it to fall back into the atmosphere on the 4th of January 1958.",
    "The first being to orbit the Earth was a female part-Samoyed terrier - Laika. The pressurized cabin on Sputnik 2 allowed enough room for her to lie down or stand and was padded.An air regeneration system provided oxygen; food and water were dispensed in a gelatinized form. Laika was fitted with a harness, a bag to collect waste, and electrodes to monitor vital signs. Sputnik 2 launched into Earth orbit, on 3 November 1957. After reaching orbit the nose cone was jettisoned successfully but the Blok A core did not separate as planned. This inhibited the operation of the thermal control system. Additionally some of the thermal insulation tore loose so the interior temperatures reached 40 C. Because of the thermal problems she probably only survived a day or two. The mission provided scientists with the first data on the behavior of a living organism orbiting in the space environment.",
    "Explorer 1 changed rotation axis after launch. The elongated body of the spacecraft had been designed to spin about its long axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements. This experiment, revealed a much lower cosmic ray count than expected. Scientists theorized that the instrument may have been saturated by very strong radiation from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by Earth's magnetic field.",
    "On 3 January, at a distance of 113,000 km from Earth, a large cloud of sodium gas was released by the spacecraft. This glowing orange trail of gas, visible over the Indian Ocean with the brightness of a sixth-magnitude star, allowed astronomers to track the spacecraft. It also served as an experiment on the behavior of gas in outer space. There were five different sets of scientific devices for studying interplanetary space, including a magnetometer, geiger counter, scintillation counter, and micrometeorite detector, and other equipment. The measurements obtained during this mission provided new data on the Earth's radiation belt and outer space, including the discovery that the Moon had no magnetic field and that a solar wind, a strong flow of ionized plasma emmanating from the Sun, streamed through interplanetary space.",
    "Luna 2 was the second of a series of spacecraft launched in the direction of the Moon. The first spacecraft to land on the Moon, it impacted the lunar surface east of Mare Serenitatis near the Aristides, Archimedes, and Autolycus craters. Luna 2 was similar in design to Luna 1, a spherical spacecraft with protruding antennae and instrument parts. There were no propulsion systems on Luna 2 itself. The mission confirmed that the Moon had no appreciable magnetic field, and found no evidence of radiation belts at the Moon.",
    "Initial radio contact showed the signal from the probe was only about half as strong as expected and the interior temperature was increasing. At a distance of 60,000 to 70,000 km from the Moon, the orientation system was turned on and the spacecraft rotation was stopped. The spacecraft passed within 6,200 km of the Moon. On 7 October the photocell on the upper end of the spacecraft detected the sunlit far side of the Moon and the photography sequence started. The first image was taken at a distance of 63,500 km from the Moon's surface.. A total of 29 photographs were taken, covering 70% of the far side. After the photography was complete the spacecraft resumed spinning, passed over the north pole of the Moon and returned towards the Earth.",
    "The video systems relayed thousands of pictures containing cloud-cover views of the Earth. Early photographs provided information concerning the structure of large-scale cloud regimes. TIROS-I was operational for only 78 days, but proved that satellites could be a useful tools for surveying global weather conditions from space.",
    "Gagarin and Vostok 1 launched around midday.  He entered orbit a few minutes later and was able to see the Earth through a single window near his feet. Most of the flight was automated, though Gagarin had the ability to take manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency. After one orbit, the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere and landed in Kazakhstan 1 hour 48 minutes after launch. Radio communications with earth were continuous during the flight, and television transmissions were also made from space.",
    "En route to Venus, Mariner 2 measured the solar wind, a constant stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, confirming the measurements by Luna 1 in 1959. It also measured interplanetary dust, which turned out to be scarcer than predicted. In addition, Mariner 2 detected high-energy charged particles coming from the Sun, including several brief solar flares, as well as cosmic rays from outside the Solar System. As it flew by Venus on December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 scanned the planet with its pair of radiometers, revealing that Venus has cool clouds and an extremely hot surface.",
    "This flight lasted for 3 days and, for most of this time, Vostok 6 flew with Vostok 5 maintaining two-way radio communications and establishing communications with earth at regular intervals. TV pictures of the cosmonauts in their cabins were relayed to earth, and a series of biomedical and scientific experiments were conducted. Tereshkova maintained a flight log, took photographs, and manually oriented the spacecraft.",
    "The spacecraft was equipped with an extendable air lock that permitted Leonov's exit into space without having to evacuate the main cabin air. Leonov was the first man to perform an EVA (ExtraVehicular Activity) in space. For this EVA a space suit was donned, and a life-support system was worn in a back pack. The EVA was recorded by a mounted extended TV camera. Leonov also carried a handheld movie camera. The EVA lasted 20 min, during which Leonov experienced tension and euphoria. A manually controlled reentry was performed because of a malfunction of the automatic orientation devices for the retrofire, and the spacecraft landed in a pine forest far north of the target area. After locating the spacecraft, one day was required to cut through the forest and bring the crew out on skis.",
    "Launched on November 28, 1964, Mariner 4 performed the first successful flyby of the planet Mars, returning the first close-up pictures of the Martian surface. It captured the first images of another planet ever returned from deep space; their depiction of a Moon-like cratered terrain, dead planet largely changed the scientific community's view of life on Mars.",
    "Luna 9 had landed near the rim of a 25 meter diameter crater at a tilt of about 15 degrees. The probe took the first full panorama, and then slipped as the regolith on the slope settled. Two more panoramas were obtained. The pictures included views of nearby rocks and of the horizon 1.4 km away from the spacecraft. Radiation data were also returned, showing a dosage of about 30 millirads per day.  The probe also proved that the lunar surface could support the weight of a lander and that an object would not sink into a loose layer of dust as some models predicted.",
    "Apollo 8 took 68 hours to travel the distance to the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours, during which they made a Christmas Eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the Book of Genesis. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed an \"Earthrise\" in person for the first time in human history.",
    "After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20. At 10:56 PM on July 20, Armstrong stepped out onto the lunar soil with the words, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” He immediately described the surface as “fine and powdery” and said that there was no difficulty moving about. During their moon walk of more than two hours, Armstrong and Aldrin set up a device to measure the composition of the solar wind reaching the Moon, a device to receive laser beams from astronomical observatories on Earth. They also took about 23 kg of rock and soil samples, took many photographs, and maintained constant communication with mission control in Houston, Texas. After 21 hours 38 minutes on the Moon’s surface, the astronauts used Eagle’s ascent stage to launch it back into lunar orbit. After various maneuvers, Eagle once again docked with Collins in Columbia, and the trip back to Earth began soon afterward.",
    "This was the first successful Soviet sample return, and the first fully robotic sample return of any nation. The Luna 16 lander drilled to a depth of 35 mm before hitting rock, withdrew the core sample and sealed it in a small spherical capsule for return to Earth. The capsule, containing more than 100 grams of lunar soil, landed safely in Kazakhstan 12 days after the initial launch from Earth. The dark, powdery basalt material was found to be very similar to that obtained from another mare site by Apollo 12. It differed slightly from Apollo 11's samples in the levels of titanium and zirconium oxide.",
    "Venera 7 was a Soviet spacecraft, part of the Venera series of probes to Venus. When it landed on the Venusian surface on 15 December 1970, it became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth. Venera 7 was the first spacecraft to transmit data from the surface of any extraterrestrial planet, though its success was uncertain at first. The probe sent data to Earth for 35 minutes while falling through the atmosphere, but the data transmission appeared to be replaced by noise as soon as the capsule hit the ground. Computer processing revealed, however, that this noise contained nearly 23 minutes of additional information at 1 percent of normal signal strength. The transmitted data indicated a surface temperature of 475 give or take 20 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 90 give or take 15 atmospheres.",
    "Launch was planned for April 12, 1971 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight on Vostok 1, but technical problems delayed it until April 19. The first crew launched later in the Soyuz 10 mission, but they ran into troubles while docking and were unable to enter the station; the Soyuz 10 mission was aborted and the crew returned safely to Earth. A replacement crew launched on Soyuz 11 and remained on board for 23 days. This was the first time in the history of spaceflight that a space station had been occupied, and a new record was set for time spent in space.",
    "Mariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. When it arrived at Mars on November 14, 1971, planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with \"a planet-wide robe of dust, the largest storm ever observed.\" The surface was totally obscured. Mariner 9's computer was thus reprogrammed from Earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled. The main surface imaging did not get underway until mid-January 1972. However, surface-obscured images did contribute to the collection of Mars science, including understanding of the existence of several huge high-altitude volcanoes of the Tharsis Bulge that gradually became visible as the dust storm abated. This unexpected situation made a strong case for the desirability of studying a planet from orbit rather than merely flying past.",
    "The descent module was separated from the orbiter on 2 December 1971 at 09:14 UT.  Fifteen minutes later the descent engine was fired to point the aeroshield forward. Then the module entered the martian atmosphere at 5.7 km/sec. The braking parachute was then deployed, followed by the main chute. At an altitude of 20 to 30 meters at a velocity of 60 - 110 m/s the main parachute was disconnected and a small rocket propelled it off to the side. Simultaneously the lander retrorockets were fired. The entire atmospheric entry sequence took a little over 3 minutes. Mars 3 impacted the surface at a reported 20.7 m/s . The four petal shaped covers opened and the capsule began transmitting to the Mars 3 orbiter at 13:52:05 UT, 90 seconds after landing. After 20 seconds, at 13:52:25, transmission stopped for unknown reasons and no further signals were received at Earth from the martian surface. It is not known whether the fault originated with the lander or the communications relay on the orbiter.",
    "On November 6, 1973, the Pioneer 10 spacecraft was at a distance of 25 million km from Jupiter. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. Red and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument's field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. The trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the ion radiation was concentrated. Peak flux for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth. Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated.",
    "Following launch and a 10 month cruise to Mars, the orbiter began returning global images of Mars about 5 days before orbit insertion. The Viking 1 Orbiter was inserted into Mars orbit on 19 June 1976. Imaging of candidate sites was begun and the landing site was selected based on these pictures. The lander separated from the orbiter on 20 July 08:51 UT and landed at Chryse Planitia. Viking 1 carried a biology experiment whose purpose was to look for evidence of life. In addition, independent of the biology experiments, Viking carried a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer that could measure the composition and abundance of organic compounds in the Martian soil. The orbiter primary mission ended at the beginning of solar conjunction on 5 November 1976. The extended mission commenced on 14 December 1976 after solar conjunction. Operations included close approaches to Phobos in February 1977. Minor orbit adjustments were done occasionally over the course of the mission, primarily to change the walk rate.",
    "Pioneer 11 passed by Saturn on September 1, 1979, at a distance of 21,000 km from Saturn's cloud tops. Pioneer 11 imaged and nearly collided with one of Saturn's small moons, passing at a distance of no more than 4,000 kilometers. The object was tentatively identified as Epimetheus. Besides Epimetheus, instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet-size moon, Titan, to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the ring plane, the probe sent back pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings, which normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the Pioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as bright rings.",
    "Despite the difficulties encountered, scientists and engineers had been able to make Voyager enormously successful. As a result, approval was granted to extend the mission, first to Uranus, then to Neptune and later to continue observations well past Neptune. Voyager 2 made successful flybys of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the additional distance of these two planets, adaptations had to made to accomodate the lower light levels and decreased communications. Voyager 2 was successfully able to obtain about 8,000 images of Uranus and its satellites. Additional improvements in the on-board software and use of image compression techniques allowed about 10,000 images of Neptune and its satellites to be taken.",
    "The spacecraft encountered the comet on March 13, 1986, at a distance of 0.89 AU from the sun. The goal was to come within 500 km of Halley's comet at closest encounter. The actual closest approach was measured at 596 km. Images showed Halley's nucleus to be a dark peanut-shaped body, 15 km long, 7 km to 10 km wide.  Analysis showed the comet formed 4.5 billion years ago from volatiles (mainly ice) that had condensed onto interstellar dust particles. It had remained practically unaltered since its formation.",
    "Placed into a low-earth orbit by the space shuttle, HST was designed to be modular so that on subsequent shuttle missions it could be recovered, have faulty or obsolete parts replaced with new and/or improved instruments, and be re-released. HST was roughly cylindrical in shape, 13.1 m end-to-end and 4.3 m in diameter at its widest point. The HST’s discoveries have revolutionized astronomy. Observations of Cepheid variables in nearby galaxies allowed the first accurate determination of Hubble’s constant, which is the rate of the universe’s expansion. The HST photographed young stars with disks that will eventually become planetary systems. The Hubble Deep Field, a photograph of about 1,500 galaxies, revealed galactic evolution over nearly the entire history of the universe. Within the solar system, the HST was also used to discover Hydra and Nix, two moons of the dwarf planet Pluto.",
    "Galileo orbited Jupiter for almost eight years, and made close passes by all its major moons. Its camera and nine other instruments sent back reports that allowed scientists to determine, among other things, that Jupiter’s icy moon Europa probably has a subsurface ocean with more water than the total amount found on Earth. They discovered that the volcanoes of the moon Io repeatedly and rapidly resurface the little world. They found that the giant moon Ganymede possesses its own magnetic field. Galileo even carried a small probe that it deployed and sent deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, taking readings for almost an hour before the probe was crushed by overwhelming pressure.",
    "Launched on December 4, 1996, by NASA aboard a Delta II booster a month after the Mars Global Surveyor was launched, it landed on July 4, 1997, on Mars's Ares Vallis, in a region called Chryse Planitia in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. The lander then opened, exposing the rover which conducted many experiments on the Martian surface. The mission carried a series of scientific instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere, climate, and geology and the composition of its rocks and soil. In addition to scientific objectives, the Mars Pathfinder mission was also a \"proof-of-concept\" for various technologies, such as airbag-mediated touchdown and automated obstacle avoidance, both later exploited by the Mars Exploration Rover mission.",
    "It was the first spacecraft to successfully orbit an asteroid and also land on an asteroid. During a year spent in close orbit (5–56 km) around Eros, NEAR Shoemaker studied the object’s mass, structure, geology, composition, gravity, and magnetic field. The surface of Eros had both very smooth, flat areas and regions covered with large boulders. NEAR found that Eros, unlike the planets of the solar system, had not undergone extensive melting and differentiation into distinct layers. On Feb. 12, 2001, the spacecraft survived a landing on the surface of Eros, returning images of objects as small as 1 cm across during its final descent and sending back scientific data from the asteroid’s surface for a few more days after landing.",
    "Cassini revealed in great detail the true wonders of Saturn, a giant world ruled by raging storms and delicate harmonies of gravity. That expanded our understanding of the kinds of worlds where life might exist. Cassini-Huygens revealed Titan to be one of the most Earth-like worlds we’ve encountered and shed light on the history of our home planet. What Cassini found at Saturn prompted scientists to rethink their understanding of the solar system. Orbiter revealed the beauty of Saturn, its rings and moons, inspiring our sense of wonder.",
    "Genesis launched successfully  on 8 August 2001 on a Delta 7326. Approximately 1 hour later the spacecraft left low Earth orbit on a three month journey out towards the L1 Lagrangian Sun-Earth libration point, 0.01 AU from Earth, to be inserted into a halo orbit about the L1 point.  On 3 December 2001 it opened its collector arrays and began gathering samples of solar wind particles. The samples were stowed and sealed in the contamination-tight canister within the Sample Return Capsule and returned to Earth over a five month period.",
    "Hayabusa2 arrived at Ryugu on June 27, 2018. Rovers 1A and 1B landed on Ryugu on September 22 and were the first rovers to land on an asteroid’s surface. MASCOT landed on Ryugu on October 3, it functioned for 17 hours. The Hayabusa2 spacecraft itself finally landed on Ryugu on February 22, 2019. It fired a small tantalum bullet into the surface, creating a cloud of dust that was collected by a sample horn. Hayabusa2 stayed at Ryugu until November 2019 and then returned the sample capsule to Earth in the desert near Woomera, Australia, on December 6, 2020. The spacecraft continued on through the solar system, making observations of zodiacal light and stars with transiting extrasolar planets.",
    "Messenger was launched on August 3, 2004, by a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The nominal mission lasted one year and was subsequently extended for another year.  Messenger’s most-notable finding was confirming the presence of large amounts of water ice in permanently shadowed craters at Mercury’s poles. Messenger’s first flyby revealed that the planet’s craters are only half as deep as those of the Moon. Mercury’s Caloris impact basin, one of the youngest and largest impact features in the solar system, was found to have evidence of volcanic vents. Messenger also discovered lobate scarps, which are huge cliffs at the top of crustal faults. Those structures indicate that the planet, as it cooled early in its history, shrank by a third more than what had previously been believed. Messenger also discovered that Mercury’s core is much larger than previously thought and extends from the centre to about 85 percent of the planet’s radius. It found several possible mascons in Mercury’s northern hemisphere that are similar to those found on the Moon, and it discovered evidence that Mercury was geologically active even after the formation of the Caloris basin 3.8 billion years ago.",
    "Philae took seven hours to descend to the comet’s surface. The lander was to fire two harpoons and use three ice screws in its legs to anchor itself to the surface of the comet. Rosetta orbited Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko for more than two years until its mission ended with a controlled crash into the comet on September 30, 2016. Many features of the comet that Rosetta discovered surprised scientists. The comet had a double-lobed, “rubber-duck”-like structure that was the result of the collision and subsequent joining of two smaller comets. Rosetta also made the first detection of molecular oxygen at a comet; molecular oxygen is strongly reactive but nevertheless was likely part of the comet when it formed. Rosetta also discovered several organic molecules, including the amino acid glycine.",
    "Launch from Cape Canaveral on a Delta 2  took place on 27 September at 11:34 UT. Transfer into a trajectory towards the asteroid belt took place approximately 1 hour later. On its approach to Ceres, Dawn observed two very bright spots, in Occator crater. The bright spots were highly reflective salts left behind when briny water from an underground reservoir percolated upward and evaporated. The water percolated through fractures left behind when the crater formed 20 million years ago. Since the salty regions had not been darkened by micrometeorite impacts, the bright spots had formed in the last 2 million years. Because the bright spots contain salt compounds with water that has not dehydrated, the briny water must have percolated upward in the last few hundred years, suggesting that the salty liquid water underneath the crater has not frozen and is perhaps currently percolating from underground.",
    "New Horizons launched at 19:00 UT on 19 January 2006 and flyby of Pluto took place on 14 July 2015. Long range imaging included 40 km mapping of Pluto and Charon 3.2 days out. This is half the rotation period of Pluto-Charon and allowed imaging of the side of both bodies which were facing away from the spacecraft at closest approach. New Horizons flew within 12500 km of Pluto at a relative velocity of 11 km/s at closest approach. During the flyby the instruments were able to obtain images with resolution as high as about 25 m/pixel, 4-color global dayside maps at 0.7 km/pixe. New Horizons continued out towards the Kuiper Belt. A 16-minute hydrazine thruster maneuver on 22 October 2015 put the spacecraft on course towards Kuiper Belt object Arrokoth. Three more maneuvers over the next two weeks put it on course for a flyby of Arrokoth, which it performed on 1 January 2019. Closest approach distance was 3500 km. Similar measurements to those made at Pluto were conducted.",
    "On December 21, 2015, a Falcon 9 launched a payload into orbit, and its first stage made a landing at Cape Canaveral. The first Falcon 9 first-stage ship landing happened on April 8, 2016, and SpaceX did its first relaunch of a previously flown Falcon 9 first stage on March 30, 2017. The first Falcon Heavy test flight occurred on February 6, 2018. The central core stage was not recovered, but the two side boosters successfully returned to Cape Canaveral. Today's landing was a milestone moment for SpaceX, which aims to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets as a way to open the heavens to exploration. Such technology could slash the cost of spaceflight by a factor of 100, potentially making Mars colonies economically feasible.",
    "Launch took place at 2:23 a.m. on December 8, 2018 Beijing time and Chang'e 4 entered lunar orbit on 12 December. After three weeks of lunar orbital maneuvers, Chang'e-4 landed in Von Karman crater in the South Pole-Aitkin Basin on 3 January 2019 at 02:26 UT, becoming the first spacecraft to make a controlled landing on the far side of the Moon. The Yutu-2 rover was driven down ramps onto the surface about 12 hours later. The rover moved forwards towards a small crater and turned on its instruments. The lander and rover carry scientific payloads to study the geophysics of the landing zone, with a life science and modest chemical analysis capability."
