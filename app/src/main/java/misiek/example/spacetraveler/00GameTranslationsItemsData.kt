    "Steel is the world’s most important engineering and construction material. Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, machines, electrical appliances, weapons, and rockets.",
    "Gold is a dense, lustrous, yellow, malleable precious metal, so durable that it is virtually indestructible, often found uncombined in nature. Though gold is attacked by free chlorine, its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin-layer coating on electrical connectors, thereby ensuring good connection.",
    "As a metal, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile, lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other metals. Because of that is used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles.",
    "Cobalt is a lustrous very hard silvery metal belonging to a group called the \"transition metals\". It is one of only 3 ferromagnetic transition elements along with iron and nickel. Lithium cobalt oxide is widely used in lithium-ion battery cathodes. The temperature stability of Cobalt-based superalloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and aircraft jet engines.",
    "Uranium is a dense, hard metallic element that is silvery white in colour. It is ductile, malleable, and capable of taking a high polish. In air the metal tarnishes and when finely divided breaks into flames. Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons."

    "The iron is producing in small shaft furnaces as solid lumps, called blooms, and these were then hot forged into bars of wrought iron, a malleable material containing bits of slag and charcoal.",
    "In order to convert wrought iron into steel that is, increase the carbon content a carburization process was used. Iron billets were heated with charcoal in sealed clay pots that were placed in large bottle-shaped kilns holding a lot of charcoal.",
    "Basic oxygen steelmaking is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbon-rich pig iron is melted and converted into steel. Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron converts some of the carbon in the iron into CO and CO2, turning it into steel. Refractories line the smelting vessel to withstand the high temperature and corrosive nature of the molten metal and slag. The chemistry of the process is controlled to ensure that impurities such as silicon and phosphorus are removed from the metal.",
    "The open-hearth furnace was fired with air and fuel gas that were preheated by combustion gases to 800° C. A flame temperature of about 2,000° C  could be obtained, and this was sufficient to melt the charge. Refining - that is, removal of carbon, manganese, and silicon from the metal - was achieved by a reaction between the slag and the liquid metal in the hearth of the furnace.",
    "Electric arc furnace steelmaking is the manufacture of steel from scrap or direct reduced iron melted by electric arcs. In an electric arc furnace, a batch of iron is loaded into the furnace, sometimes with a \"hot heel\". As in basic oxygen steelmaking, fluxes are also added to protect the lining of the vessel and help improve the removal of impurities.",
    "Made from iron and carbon, this type of steel product can be adjusted to influence the product’s quality and flexibility. When mixed with high levels of carbon, the product becomes hard and non-malleable, such as cast iron.",
    "Galvanized steel involves coating steel in zinc to prevent corrosion. A zinc coating remains effective in shielding the base metal from corrosive substances even if it’s scratched or wears out over time.",
    "In HIsarna ironmaking process, iron ore is processed almost directly into liquid iron or hot metal. The process is based around a type of blast furnace called a cyclone converter furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets that is necessary for the basic oxygen steelmaking process. Without the necessity of this preparatory step, the HIsarna process is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional steelmaking processes.",
    "Steel can be produced from direct-reduced iron, which in turn can be produced from iron ore as it undergoes chemical reduction with hydrogen. Renewable hydrogen allows steelmaking without the use of fossil fuels. The iron is infused with carbon (from coal) in an electric arc furnace.",
    "Secondary steelmaking is most commonly performed in ladles. Some of the operations performed in ladles include de-oxidation, vacuum degassing, alloy addition, inclusion removal, inclusion chemistry modification, de-sulphurisation, and homogenisation. Tight control of ladle metallurgy is associated with producing high grades of steel in which the tolerances in chemistry and consistency are narrow.",
    "To make pure steel, iron and carbon are needed. To make steel, the iron needs to be separated from the oxygen and a tiny amount of carbon needs to be added. Both are accomplished by melting the iron ore at a very high temperature (1,700 degrees Celsius or over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit) in the presence of oxygen and a type of coal called coke. At those temperatures, the iron ore releases its oxygen, which is carried away by the carbon from the coke in the form of carbon dioxide.",
    "To reduce the carbon content in pig iron and obtain the desired carbon content of steel, the pig iron is re-melted and oxygen is blown through in a process called basic oxygen steelmaking, which occurs in a ladle. In this step, the oxygen binds with the undesired carbon, carrying it away in the form of carbon dioxide gas, an additional source of emissions. After this step, the carbon content in the pig iron is lowered sufficiently and steel is obtained.",
    "Further carbon dioxide emissions result from the use of limestone, which is melted at high temperatures in a reaction called calcination.Carbon dioxide is an additional source of emissions in this reaction. Modern industry has introduced calcium oxide as an replacement. It acts as a chemical flux, removing impurities in the form of slag and keeps emissions of CO2 low.",
    "Further carbon dioxide emissions result from the hot blast, which is used to increase the heat of the blast furnace. The hot blast pumps hot air into the blast furnace where the iron ore is reduced to pig iron, helping to achieve the high activation energy.",

    "Gold panning, or simply panning, is a form of placer mining and traditional mining that extracts gold from a placer deposit using a pan. The process is one of the simplest ways to extract gold, and is popular with geology enthusiasts especially because of its low cost and relative simplicity.",
    "Recreational gold mining and prospecting has become a popular outdoor recreation in a number of countries, including New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Wales, in Canada and in the United States especially.",
    "Placer mining is the technique by which gold that has accumulated in a placer deposit is extracted. Placer deposits are composed of relatively loose material that makes tunnelling difficult, and so most means of extracting it involve the use of water or dredging.",
    "Using a sluice box to extract gold from placer deposits has long been a very common practice in prospecting and small-scale mining. A sluice box is essentially a man made channel with riffles set in the bottom. The riffles are designed to create dead zones in the current to allow gold to drop out of suspension. The box is placed in the stream to channel water flow. Gold-bearing material is placed at the top of the box. The material is carried by the current through the volt where gold and other dense material settles out behind the riffles. Less dense material flows out of the box as tailings.",
    "Gold is also produced by mining in which it is not the principal product. Large copper mine often recover considerable amounts of gold and other metals along with copper. A modest amount of precious metal is a by-product of sodium production.",
    "Hard rock gold mining extracts gold encased in rock, rather than fragments in loose sediment. The world's deepest hard rock gold mine is 3,900 meters underground. At such depths, the heat is unbearable for humans, and air conditioning is required for the safety of the workers.",
    "These are small machines that float on the water and are usually operated by one or two people. A suction dredge consists of a sluice box supported by pontoons, attached to a suction hose which is controlled by a miner working beneath the water. A large gold dredge uses a mechanical method to excavate material (sand, gravel, dirt, etc.) using steel \"buckets\" on a circular, continuous \"bucketline\" at the front end of the dredge. The material is then sorted/sifted using water.",
    "Also called a cradle, a rocker box uses riffles located in a high-walled box to trap gold in a similar manner to the sluice box. A rocker box uses less water than a sluice box and is well suited for areas where water is limited. A rocking motion provides the water movement needed for the gravity separation of gold in placer material.",
    "Cyanide extraction of gold is the dominant method for obtaining gold. Finely ground rock is treated with a solution of sodium cyanide. The extract is absorbed onto carbon. The gold can be removed from the carbon by using a strong solution of caustic soda and cyanide. Gold cyanide is then converted to relatively pure gold by a variety of methods.",
    "The mine is located about 550 km northwest of Montreal. The gold deposit, which extends a couple kilometers along the Cadillac fault includes porphyry gold. It is an open pit mine that uses cyanidation following by electrowinning and smelting to produce gold bars.",
    "The gold in the Witwatersrand Basin area was deposited in ancient river deltas, having been washed down from surrounding gold-rich greenstone belts to the north and west. Rhenium-osmium isotope studies indicates that the gold in those mineral deposits came from unusual three billion year old mantle sourced intrusions known as komatiites present in the edenvale belts.",
    "Most gold mined in Australia today cannot be seen in the rock, it is very fine grained and mostly has a concentration of less than 5 grams in every tonne of rock mined. There are both open-cut and underground gold mines in Australia but most of Australia's gold production comes from open-cut mines. Earth-moving equipment is used to remove waste rock from above the ore body and then to mine the ore.",
    "Russia is the world’s second largest gold-producing nation. More than one-half of Russia's hard rock gold resources occur in the Maiskoye, Natalkinskoe, Nezhdaninskoe, Olimpiada, and the Sukhoi Log deposits in Siberia and in the Russian Far East.",
    "Gold mining in the United States has taken place continually since the discovery of gold at the Reed farm in North Carolina in 1799. The large scale production of gold started with the California Gold Rush in 1848. United States has the world's largest gold mining corporation which owns gold mines in Nevada, Colorado, Ontario, Quebec, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Ghana, Argentina, Peru, and Suriname.",

    "Regardless of the final usage titanium must first be removed from its ore and turned into pure titanium. This is done by processing titanium oxide manufactured from either ilmenite or rutile though the Kroll process. The output is a titanium sponge which is purified, melted and alloyed with other metals.",
    "VAR has been the primary method of titanium alloy manufacture since the 1950s. VAR exercises precise control over the melting and solidification of the melt which allows the reliable creation of high quality finished alloys with excellent purity. The VAR process takes place in a large cylindrical crucible. The electrode is suspended from the top with several kiloamperes of DC current passed through it to cause it to melt and drip to the bottom of the chamber where the alloy reforms.",
    "Cold hearth melting provides an effective fix to one of the deficiencies of the VAR process the ability to effectively remove high density and low-density inclusions from the melt. It is also used to process waste chips from the machining process. A vacuum is formed inside a water-cooled copper hearth. Then a high-temperature electron beam is concentrated onto the titanium feedstock placed in the hearths rear. The molten titanium drips into the melting area, it then flows into a refining channel before pouring into the mould where the metal crystallises. Volatile compounds evaporate namely oxygen and nitrogen inclusions whilst dense tungsten carbide from cutting tools sinks to the bottom. The extremities of the ingot are then machined away leaving the titanium alloy.",
    "Forging is the application of thermal and mechanical energy to titanium billets or ingots to cause the material to change shape while in a solid state. Due to the reactivity of the metal and the high temperatures and pressures involved the ingot is coated with protective glaze/glass. This prevents it reacting with the atmosphere whilst also allowing it to deform. The process of forging allows the desired microstructure of the metal to be developed effectively.",
    "Heat treatment allows phases to be manipulated in an alpha beta alloy. The variables altered are compositions, sizes, and distributions. Titanium alloys are heat treated to reduce the residual stresses arising during production and annealing for the optimal combination of ductility, machinability, dimensional stability and structural stability.",
    "Annealing is a metallurgical heat treating process of titanium that alters its chemical and physical properties. It causes atoms to migrate within the metals lattice allowing alterations to an alloy’s properties to be made.",
    "This is the most common form of heat treatment. It is used in a wide range of titanium alloys including alpha and near alpha alloys as well as alpha beta and meta-stable beta alloys. The aim is to reduce residual stresses that are developed during fabrication.",
    "Solution annealing, quenching and then aging yields the highest strength titanium alloys. A titanium alloy’s beta phase begins to decompose at temperatures below the beta transus, exceeding it in some alpha beta alloys can reduce the metal’s ductility.",
    "The method of oxygen removal from titanium metal is one of the most important recycling technologies. With the presently available technology, the direct removal of oxygen from titanium metal is very difficult. In this process, crude titanium metal is anodically dissolved into molten salt as titanium ions on the anode, and high-purity titanium is deposited on the cathode.",

    "The copper and cobalt ores are found in a 500-million-year-old mountain chain in two zones, weathered oxide deposits that extend to a depth between 70 m and 150 m and unweathered sulfide deposits below these oxide deposits at depths greater than 250 m. The weathered part of the deposit is easily mined by surface scrapers, bulldozers and diggers. Sulfide minerals are generally deeper in the deposit and more expensive to mine and to treat for metal recovery.",
    "The ores are treated by a sulfatizing roast in a fluidized bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides. In the final stages, this cobalt hydroxide is redissolved and the metal is refined by electrolysis. The resulting cobalt cathodes are crushed and vacuum degassed to obtain a pure cobalt metal.",
    "Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or flash smelting to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, or they may be treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach.",
    "The ore is comminuted and the cobalt rich oxides are separated by froth flotation. The cobalt-bearing concentrate is then mixed with lime and coal, and then melted in a reducing atmosphere. Iron and lighter impurities float to the surface as solid dross or are expelled from the melt as gas. The remaining liquid is composed of copper and cobalt.",
    "Nickel-cobalt lateritic ores can be treated by either hydrometallurgical processes or pyrometallurgical processes, such as matte or ferronickel smelting, which require the entire ore to be melted and the metal values to be separated from the residual components of the ore. The hydrometallurgical process for laterite ore can use sulfuric acid or ammonia leach solutions.",
    "Arsenic containing concentrates are roasted to remove 60% to 70% of the arsenic present as arsenic oxide. The roasted ores are treated with hydrochloric acid and chlorine or with sulfuric acid to give a leach solution that can be purified by hydrometallurgical methods and from which cobalt can be recovered by electro refining or by carbonate precipitation.",
    "If purifying by electrolysis, an aqueous sulfate solution at 50 to 70°C is usually used with a lead anode and a stainless steel cathode which will allow for the easy removal of the deposited cobalt. Electro refining in a chloride or sulfate medium at -0.3 V will make a cathode coating of 99.98% Cobalt.",
    "Cobalt can be “mined” from Geobacteries, bacteria found in soil and sediment. Scientists found that Geobacteries are able to extract cobalt from rust without letting it penetrate their cells and kill them. They form cobalt nanoparticles on their surface. They metallize themselves and it’s like a shield that protects them.",

    "Heap leaching is an extraction process by which chemicals are used to extract the economic element from ore which has been mined and placed in piles on the surface.",
    "In-situ leaching, also known as solution mining, or in-situ recovery, involves leaving the ore where it is in the ground, and recovering the minerals from it by dissolving them and pumping the pregnant solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered. Consequently, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock generated.",
    "One method of extracting uranium from seawater is using a uranium-specific nonwoven fabric as an adsorbent. Adsorbents have been synthesized that have a functional group that selectively adsorbs heavy metals, and the performance of such adsorbents has been improved. Uranium adsorption capacity of the polymer fiber adsorbent is high, approximately tenfold greater in comparison to the conventional titanium oxide adsorbent.",
