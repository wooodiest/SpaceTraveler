The project was started at the end of the summer 2022 and I worked on it for several months. It was actually my first major project and one of the first in Android Studio using Kotlin. I would definitely do it better now, but I'm still very proud of it and I learned a lot along the way. Maybe the project structure and code are not clean, but everything works :)
